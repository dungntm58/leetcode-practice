/// Find First Palindromic String in the Array
// Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array.
// If there is no such string, return an empty string "".
// A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
// Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
// Output: "ada"
// Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
// Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
// Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
// Output: "racecar"
// Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
// Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
// Output: ""
// Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.

/// Adding Spaces to a String

/// Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock

// The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.
// Return the number of smooth descent periods.
// Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
// [3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
// Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.
// Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]

/// Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing
// You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.
// The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.
// For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:
// arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
// arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
// arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
// arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)
// However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).
// In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.
// Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
// Output: 4
// Explanation:
// For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
// Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
// It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
// It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.
// Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
// Output: 0
// Explanation:
// This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
// Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
// Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
// Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
// One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
// The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
// Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.
